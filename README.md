# uggish-vehiclespawner

This script is a script on which a vehicle is spawned, only one vehicle is spawned, but if you want more to come, you restart the script e.g. a number of times until you see that they have been spawned. You can easily add more vehicles to the Config file. If you want the vehicles to change position, you can do so easily in the Config file. The positions that I added are just several examples.
